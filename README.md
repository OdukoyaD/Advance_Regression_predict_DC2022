# Advanced-Regression-Starter-Data

Hi Team,

This would be our collaborative space.

The file with the team name would be our final file where we would have all the accepted code and which we would eventually submit.

Everyone should also have a notebook with their name attached to it which should be pushed to this repository before the due date of each of our deliverables.

It is from these individual notebooks that we would create the final one for the team for submission.

Let's have a wonderful time building models
